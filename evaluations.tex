\chapter{Experimental Evaluation}\label{c:evaluations}



We measured the runtime performance of our privacy\hyp preserving algorithms using the Sharemind secure computing platform.
We instantiated all private aggregators and decision tree classifiers using the SecreC programming language \cite{jagomagis2010secrec} that Sharemind provides.
In Sharemind, the number of the computing parties are restricted by the SMPC protocol that is been used.
Our experiments use the \textit{pd\_shared3p} security protocol, which utilizes three nodes in the private domain.


\textbf{Experimental Setup:}
All experiments were performed on three 64-bit virtual machines (VM), each running Ubuntu 18.04.
The three VMs share an Intel Xeon E5-2670 (v2) at 2.50 GHz.
Each VM utilizes 6 cores and 8 GBs of memory.
