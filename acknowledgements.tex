  To start, we would like to thank our advisor Prof. Yannis E. Ioannidis for the chance he gave us to work on this research project and also for the insightful discussions we had during this thesis.
  
  We are particularly thankful for the help and advice of Minos N. Garofalakis and Omiros Metaxas all these months.

  Last but not least, we thank ATHENA Research Center for the support of this thesis in terms of My Health - My Data (MHMD) project. We would also like to express our gratitude to the MHMD team, and especially Christos Nasikas, for the fruitful discussions.
