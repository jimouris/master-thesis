\section{Encryption}
The fields of cryptography, privacy, computer and information security, design and utilize software, hardware, and human resources to address this issue.
One of the most commonly used ways of preserving data privacy is the use of encryption. Encryption is the process of encoding a message (plaintext), such that it is accessible only to authorized parties, and no one else.
The simplest form of encryption, is the use of a symmetric key scheme. Such a scheme utilizes a secret key which is used to perform the mathematical operations of both encrypting and decrypting of a message.
The communicating parties must have the same key in order to communicate securely.
