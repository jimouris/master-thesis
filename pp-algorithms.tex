\section{Notation}\label{s:notation}
Our notation for encrypted values and for operations between encrypted variables consists of a variation of the classical mathematical operations.
Namely, $\enc{X}$ corresponds to the encryption of $X$, while $\hplus$ , $\hminus$ , $\hmul$ and $\hdiv$ represent homomorphic addition, subtraction, multiplication and division respectively.
In a like manner, $\heq$ represents private equality and returns an encryption of one (that is $\enc{1}$) if the operands map to equal plaintexts, or an encryption of zero ($\enc{0}$) otherwise.
